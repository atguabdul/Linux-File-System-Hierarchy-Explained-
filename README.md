# üêß Linux File System Hierarchy Explained  

The Linux filesystem is structured in a hierarchical tree format, starting at the root directory `/`. Each directory under `/` has a specific purpose and stores different types of system and user data. Understanding this structure is fundamental for system administration, troubleshooting, and development on Linux systems.

## üóÇÔ∏è Key Linux Directories and Their Purposes  

| üìÅ **Directory** | üìù **Description** |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| **`/`**  | The root directory. Everything starts from here! |
| **`/bin`**  | Essential command binaries (e.g., `ls`, `cp`, `mv`) required for the system to boot and operate in single-user mode. |
| **`/boot`** | Files needed to boot the system, like the Linux kernel (`vmlinuz`) and bootloader (GRUB) configuration. |
| **`/dev`**  | Device files representing hardware components (e.g., `/dev/sda`, `/dev/tty`). |
| **`/etc`**  | Host-specific system-wide configuration files. Most system configuration files live here (e.g., `/etc/passwd`, `/etc/fstab`). |
| **`/home`** | User home directories (e.g., `/home/alice`). Each user has their own directory for personal files. |
| **`/lib`**  | Shared library files and kernel modules required by binaries in `/bin` and `/sbin`. |
| **`/media`** | Mount point for removable media (CD-ROMs, USB drives). |
| **`/mnt`**  | Temporary mount points for filesystems, often used for manually mounted volumes. |
| **`/opt`**  | Add-on application software packages, typically third-party apps (e.g., `/opt/google/chrome`). |
| **`/proc`** | Virtual filesystem providing process and kernel information as files (e.g., `/proc/cpuinfo`). |
| **`/root`** | Home directory for the root user (administrator). |
| **`/run`**  | Runtime data for processes since the last boot (PID files, sockets). |
| **`/sbin`** | System binaries used for system administration, generally reserved for the root user (e.g., `ifconfig`, `reboot`). |
| **`/srv`**  | Site-specific data served by the system (e.g., web server data at `/srv/www`). |
| **`/sys`**  | Virtual filesystem that provides information about devices and drivers (sysfs). |
| **`/tmp`**  | Temporary files. Often cleared at boot or on a schedule. |
| **`/usr`**  | User system resources: contains user programs, libraries, documentation (e.g., `/usr/bin`, `/usr/lib`). |
| **`/var`**  | Variable data files expected to grow, such as logs (`/var/log`), mail, and spool directories. |

## üîß Practical Tips  

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Check disk space usage  

    df -h

2Ô∏è‚É£ Explore system processes with /proc

    cat /proc/cpuinfo
    cat /proc/meminfo

3Ô∏è‚É£ List user home directories

    ls /home    

4Ô∏è‚É£ Check system logs

    tail -f /var/log/syslog    

5Ô∏è‚É£ Explore loaded kernel modules

    ls /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/    


üéØ Summary
The Linux file system hierarchy standard (FHS) helps maintain consistency across different distributions. Knowing the purpose of each directory can significantly simplify system administration, troubleshooting, and securing Linux environments.
